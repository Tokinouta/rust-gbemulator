# rust-gbemulator
A GameBoy emulator written in rust

I hope I can finish writting this little emulator. 

An emulator can help me learn the computer structure, how the CPU fetches and executes the instructions, how the memory is mapped, how to access exterior memory and peripherals, etc. And it is fun, actually, though is very time-consuming.

Personally, I want to write an emulator that can actually run a game ROM, for example, the Pokemon series. 

Let's dive into the world of GameBoy!
